# Simon-Game-
Courtesy of Angela Yu's UdeMy Web Dev Bootcamp for the sounds and CSS for this project, and the idea, although the Javascript is entirely implemented on my own. 
The Simon Game is a basic game where you have to imitate the pattern of button clicks generated by the computer. At each new level, a randomly generated button will be clicked, adding a new click to the sequence/pattern of clicks.
You have to recreate the pattern of computer-generated clicks generated since the beginning at each new level. If you fail to match the sequence, the game ends.
It is perhaps easier to simply try the game to understand the rules.
